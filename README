grabbit is a pure-python AMQP client implementation using gevent.
It implements RabbitMQ extensions and, where the spec is ambigouous,
favors RabbitMQ support. This is noted in comments where it occurs.

The large scale structure is of several layered sublibraries:
* grabbit.frames: This library deals with the serialization of data and
  the raw wire format. It exposes means of sending individual frames
  and defining classes and methods.
* grabbit.methods: Defines the standard AMQP methods (as well as RabbitMQ extensions),
  exposing means to create method calls with python data and serialize them.
* grabbit.protocol: Does the actual logic of stringing together methods and other frames
  into a coherent connection object which can perform basic operations and handle errors.
* ???: Provide a nice user-facing abstraction on top of operations?
